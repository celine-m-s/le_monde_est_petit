What if we could recreate a world to answer some of our most problematic questions? Like, what if we could say if old folks are richer than youngs? 

This program was made as an example for two of my OpenClassrooms courses: [Découvrez la programmation orientée objet]() and [Testez votre projet en Python](). Check them out!

It's a fork from [This project](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/la_poo_avec_python/tree/master).
